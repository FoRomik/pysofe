About Py\ **SOFE**
==================

|PySOFE| is Python software package for solving partial differential equations
using the finite element method in 1D, 2D or 3D.

Furthermore, the aim of this project is to provide background
information on both the theoretical and implementational aspects of
the finite element method. It is intended to serve as a starting point
for people, who are interested in the finite element method and
especially its implementation.

.. The acronym :math:`\mathbb{SOFE}` is short for **S**\ imple and
   **S**\ ophisticated **O**\ bject **O**\ riented **F**\ lexible **F**\ inite
   **E**\ lement **E**\ nvironment.

|PySOFE| as a project emerged from the lecture *FEM: Practical Aspects*
given by `Dr. Lars Ludwig <http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~ludwigl/>`_ at
`Dresden University of Technology <https://www.tu-dresden.de>`_ during the
winter term 2014/15 and is based in parts on the Matlab framework |SOFE| he
developped for his dissertation (:cite:`Ludwig13`).

Although there are many similarities in the underlying concepts, |PySOFE| is
a separat project.
