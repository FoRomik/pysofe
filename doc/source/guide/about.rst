About Py\ **SOFE**
==================

|PySOFE| is Python library for solving partial differential
equations using the finite element method.

The acronym :math:`\mathbb{SOFE}` is short for **S**\ imple and
**S**\ ophisticated **O**\ bject **O**\ riented **F**\ lexible **F**\ inite
**E**\ lement **E**\ nvironment.

It is to some extent based on the Matlab framework :math:`\mathbb{SOFE}`
developped by `Dr. Lars Ludwig`_ as part of his dissertation (:cite:`Ludwig13`).
Although there are many similarities in the underlying concepts, it is not
just a simple port but a separat project.

Besides being a finite element software the aim of |PySOFE| is
to provide insights into the implementational aspects of the method.

This *light* version of the software provides all the basic capabilities
to solve static linear equations but lacks some of the more advanced features.
